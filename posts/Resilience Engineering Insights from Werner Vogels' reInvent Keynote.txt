At hashtag#AWS hashtag#reinvent, Werner Vogels highlighted two crucial aspects of resilience engineering: 𝐬𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐜𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. Let's dive into an example that illustrates these principles in action! 💡

The Amazon Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) operates on AWS Hyperplane, an internal EC2 network service. When it comes to handling configuration changes, ELB Hyperplane employs a pull model - a great example of 𝐬𝐢𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐢𝐧 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐱 𝐬𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦𝐬.

Here's how it works: 
1️⃣ Customer changes are stored in a configuration file on Amazon S3 
2️⃣ ELB Hyperplane nodes 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐭𝐥𝐲 𝐩𝐮𝐥𝐥 this configuration every few seconds 
3️⃣ This pull occurs regardless of changes, creating a "constant work" pattern

The beauty of this approach? 🎨

• Predictable system behavior
• Consistent file size, regardless of the number of ELBs configured
• Simple to understand and implement (no PhD required! 😉)

Contrast this with a push model, where: 
❌ System performance correlates with the number of changes 
❌ Many changes can slow down the system 
❌ Slowdowns often lead to customer retries, further stressing the system

Key takeaway: In complex systems, the simplest solution is often the most resilient. It might seem counterintuitive, but sometimes the "dull" approach is the most effective! 🎯

Remember, just because we're dealing with complexity 𝐝𝐨𝐞𝐬𝐧'𝐭 𝐦𝐞𝐚𝐧 𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐛𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐝. The challenge is to find elegantly simple solutions to intricate problems.

🔑 Important insight: Solutions always depend on the angle by which a problem is approached. The ELB Hyperplane example shows how reframing the problem (from push to pull) led to a more resilient and predictable system.

What are your thoughts on this approach to resilience engineering? 

Have you encountered situations where changing your perspective led to simpler, more effective solutions?
