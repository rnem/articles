2. Select desired validity: 40 years (rds-ca-rsa2048-g1) / 100 years (rds-ca-rsa4096-g1, rds-ca-ecc384-g1)
3. Schedule updates for clients and applications before the expiry date
4. Run tests on a staging or pre-production database environment before updating in production
5. Update Production Instances (Be certain you have a solid DR strategy in place)

Ensure your databases stay secure! 🌐🔐
