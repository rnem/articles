𝐖𝐞 𝐛𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐛𝐞𝐜𝐚𝐮𝐬𝐞 𝐰𝐞 𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐲𝐨𝐮. Many of you were struggling to keep tabs on costs for apps spread across multiple accounts. Some of you even resorted to building your own tools or buying extra software to manage this.

This launch is just the beginning. We're already working on: 🔮
1. Supporting setups with multiple AWS organizations
2. Making it easier to create views using AWS Cost Categories
3. Expanding this feature to work with more of our cost management tools
