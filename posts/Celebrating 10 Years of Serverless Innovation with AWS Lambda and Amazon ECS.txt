🚀 𝗖𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗯𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝟭𝟬 𝗬𝗲𝗮𝗿𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗜𝗻𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗔𝗪𝗦 𝗟𝗮𝗺𝗯𝗱𝗮 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗔𝗺𝗮𝘇𝗼𝗻 𝗘𝗖𝗦 🎉

A decade ago, AWS Lambda and Amazon ECS revolutionized how we think about compute and containers. As we celebrate this milestone, it's incredible to see how serverless has transformed the way millions of developers and organizations innovate and scale 👉 https://lnkd.in/g2FHHHY9

Here’s where we stand today:
🌍 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝟭.𝟱 𝗺𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗰𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿𝘀 use AWS Lambda each month.
⚙️ AWS Lambda processes 𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝘁𝗿𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝗼𝗳 𝗿𝗲𝗾𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝘀 every month.
🚀 𝗠𝗼𝗿𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝗻 𝟮.𝟰 𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗘𝗖𝗦 𝘁𝗮𝘀𝗸𝘀 are launched each week.
📈 𝗢𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝟲𝟱% 𝗼𝗳 𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗻𝗲𝘄 𝗔𝗪𝗦 𝗰𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗿 𝗰𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗲𝗿𝘀 are now using Amazon ECS.

At Amazon Web Services (AWS), we’ve always been committed to empowering customers with powerful building blocks, and watching how they use them inspires continuous innovation. When we first introduced Lambda, it was a response to customers' challenges with managing EC2 fleets for simple tasks like database updates or file processing. The inefficiencies were clear, and we knew we could do better. The solution? A service that allows customers to focus on their application logic, without worrying about provisioning servers or managing infrastructure.

Over the years, AWS Lambda has evolved rapidly in response to customer needs – from microsecond billing granularity to supporting functions with up to 10 GB of memory. Each step forward has been driven by our customers’ feedback, enabling them to build faster, more scalable, and cost-efficient solutions.

As we celebrate this 𝟭𝟬-𝘆𝗲𝗮𝗿 𝗷𝗼𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘆, we’re more excited than ever about the future of serverless and containerized computing. The flexibility and scalability offered by AWS Lambda and Amazon ECS are only getting better, and we can’t wait to see what our customers will create next.

Here’s to the next decade of innovation and simplicity in cloud computing! 🚀
