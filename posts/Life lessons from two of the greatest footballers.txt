As someone who truly enjoys football, or soccer as known in the U.S., I find their words to be a reminder for us all:

1️⃣ During an event in Japan, a child attempted to speak Portuguese to 𝐂𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐚𝐧𝐨 𝐑𝐨𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐝𝐨 but struggled with the accent, prompting laughter from the journalists. Ronaldo’s response was unforgettable:

🗣️ “𝘞𝘩𝘺 𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘭𝘢𝘶𝘨𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘢𝘵 𝘩𝘪𝘮? 𝘏𝘦’𝘴 𝘥𝘰𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘩𝘪𝘴 𝘣𝘦𝘴𝘵. 𝘞𝘦 𝘴𝘩𝘰𝘶𝘭𝘥 𝘣𝘦 𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘰𝘶𝘳𝘢𝘨𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘩𝘪𝘮.” He then spoke to the child about the importance of belief, effort, and taking every opportunity.

2️⃣ At a press conference in Japan, a child posed an inspiring question to 𝐋𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐥 𝐌𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢:

“What is the most valuable lesson you’ve learned from playing football?” Messi’s response was enlightening:

🗣️ “𝘐’𝘷𝘦 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘯𝘦𝘥 𝘢𝘣𝘰𝘶𝘵 𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘱𝘰𝘯𝘴𝘪𝘣𝘪𝘭𝘪𝘵𝘺, 𝘦𝘧𝘧𝘰𝘳𝘵, 𝘴𝘢𝘤𝘳𝘪𝘧𝘪𝘤𝘦, 𝘵𝘦𝘢𝘮𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘬, 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘰𝘯𝘢𝘭 𝘨𝘳𝘰𝘸𝘵𝘩. 𝘉𝘶𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘮𝘰𝘴𝘵 𝘪𝘮𝘱𝘰𝘳𝘵𝘢𝘯𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘪𝘴 𝘵𝘰 𝘦𝘯𝘫𝘰𝘺 𝘱𝘭𝘢𝘺𝘪𝘯𝘨, 𝘦𝘴𝘱𝘦𝘤𝘪𝘢𝘭𝘭𝘺 𝘸𝘩𝘦𝘯 𝘺𝘰𝘶’𝘳𝘦 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘯𝘨 𝘢𝘯𝘥 𝘩𝘢𝘷𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘧𝘶𝘯 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘨𝘢𝘮𝘦.”
