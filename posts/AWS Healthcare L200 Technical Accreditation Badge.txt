🚀 𝐄𝐱𝐜𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐍𝐞𝐰𝐬! 🚀

I’m thrilled to share that I’ve earned the 𝗔𝗪𝗦 𝗛𝗲𝗮𝗹𝘁𝗵𝗰𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗟𝟮𝟬𝟬 𝗧𝗲𝗰𝗵𝗻𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 Badge — and I achieved this milestone after only a couple of months on the job! 🎉 👉 https://lnkd.in/epFzSuMx

While many industries represent noble and important pursuits to sustain civil societies, HCLS while not alone is quite unique in its primary mission of sustaining life and earning this badge holds a special significance for me because my father is a medical doctor. Witnessing his dedication and the critical role of healthcare in people’s lives has profoundly influenced my perspective. 

Inspired by my father's lifelong commitment to improving lives, this achievement reflects not only a deep dive into healthcare industry knowledge and my professional development, but it also represents my dedication to 𝒔𝒖𝒑𝒑𝒐𝒓𝒕𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒉𝒆𝒂𝒍𝒕𝒉𝒄𝒂𝒓𝒆 𝒂𝒅𝒗𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒆𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒔 𝒕𝒉𝒓𝒐𝒖𝒈𝒉 𝑨𝑾𝑺 𝒔𝒐𝒍𝒖𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏𝒔 with enhanced industry-specific engagements and connecting them with trusted AWS solutions to accelerate their success. 🌟💙

The 𝗜𝗻𝗱𝘂𝘀𝘁𝗿𝘆 𝗔𝗰𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗴𝗿𝗮𝗺 (IAP) has been instrumental in providing me with the insights needed to be a trusted advisor in the healthcare space. 🏥🔍 Through a comprehensive learning path, including e-learning, videos, and assessments, I’ve gained a thorough understanding of key personas, common objections, value propositions, and AWS differentiators.

Thank you to Amazon Web Services (AWS), the AWS team, AWS Training and Certifications and resources that supported me along the way. Here’s to continuing to elevate our industry expertise and exceed customer expectations! 🙌
