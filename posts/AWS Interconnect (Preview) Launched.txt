🚀 𝗕𝗥𝗘𝗔𝗞𝗜𝗡𝗚 𝗡𝗘𝗪𝗦: 𝗔𝗪𝗦 𝗟𝗮𝘂𝗻𝗰𝗵𝗲𝘀 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁 - 𝗠𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱: 𝗣𝘂𝗿𝗽𝗼𝘀𝗲-𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝘁 𝗠𝗮𝗻𝗮𝗴𝗲𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗕𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗖𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘃𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗿𝘀

Amazon Web Services (AWS) has announced the preview of AWS Interconnect, multicloud, a new managed capability providing simple, resilient, high-speed private connections between Amazon VPCs and other cloud providers (starting with Google Cloud, with Azure announced for 2026).

This moves away from "do-it-yourself" multicloud networking to provide a native, standardized way for clouds to connect.

In just a few steps in the AWS Management Console or via CLI, you can: 
1. Choose the target cloud provider 
2. Select the destination region 
3. Pick the required bandwidth

AWS and the other CSP handle provisioning, capacity, resiliency, and support, giving you a single attachment representing your network capacity to that provider.

𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀:
 • Drastically simplifies multicloud architectures for data, analytics, AI, and SaaS workloads
 • Improves security and resilience with private, encrypted, quad‑redundant connectivity 
 • Standardizes connectivity patterns across clouds instead of piecing together custom solutions

This jointly engineered multicloud networking solution uses both AWS Interconnect - multicloud and Google Cloud's Cross-Cloud Interconnect, enabling private, high-bandwidth connectivity with increased speed and simplicity.
