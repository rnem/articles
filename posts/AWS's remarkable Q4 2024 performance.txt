🚀 I'm incredibly excited to share Amazon Web Services (AWS)'s remarkable Q4 2024 performance and reflect on what has been a transformative year for cloud innovation!

The numbers tell an impressive story:
📊 $28.8B in revenue (19% YoY growth) 
💰 $10.6B in operating income

But what truly inspires me is how these results translate into real-world impact for our customers. 2024 was a year of groundbreaking AI innovation at AWS:

🧠 Launched Amazon Nova foundation models delivering superior performance at 75% lower cost
💻 Introduced Trainium2 AI chips offering 30-40% better price-performance
🔧 Expanded Amazon Bedrock to over 100 AI models, democratizing access to cutting-edge AI

What makes me most proud to be part of #AWS is seeing how customers are leveraging our technology to transform their businesses. This aligns perfectly with our customer-obsessed culture - it's not just about innovation, it's about making that innovation accessible and impactful.

As we step into 2025, I'm thrilled about our continued commitment to customer success through:

• Enhanced AI capabilities
• Industry-leading database solutions like Aurora DSQL
• Revolutionary data management with S3 Tables

Being part of a team that puts customers first and consistently pushes the boundaries of what's possible in cloud computing is truly inspiring. 
Here's to another year of helping customers innovate and transform! 💫
