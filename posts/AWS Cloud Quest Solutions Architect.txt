I'm excited to share my new badge and my journey with 𝗔𝗪𝗦 𝗖𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁! 🎮 👉 https://lnkd.in/gG8k4yr8

I recently embarked into AWS Cloud Quest, AWS's innovative game-based training program. Picture yourself navigating a 3D simulated city, tackling real-world cloud challenges, and having loads of fun! 🏙️

With AWS Cloud Quest, you can:
🛠️ Create your own avatar and take on roles like a Solutions Architect or Machine Learning specialist.
🗣️ Interact with virtual customers, translating complex business problems into technical solutions.
📚 Gain hands-on experience with labs that mirror real-world scenarios.
📝 Reinforce your knowledge with engaging quizzes.
🏅 Earn an official AWS digital badge upon completion to showcase on Credly.com.

What I really like about it:
✅ Real-world hands-on labs that provide practical experience
✅ Interactive quizzes to strengthen your understanding
✅ Official AWS digital badge credential
✅ The labs are part of the quest and completely free, so you don't end up with a huge bill! 💸

It's an incredibly engaging and effective way to build your expertise and advance your career. Thanks AWS Training and Certifications and Amazon Web Services (AWS) for making it so fun!
