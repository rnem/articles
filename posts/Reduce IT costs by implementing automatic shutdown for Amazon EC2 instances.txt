One consistent theme we hear from our customers is their desire to optimize cloud costs. Among AWS services, hashtag#EC2 instances often represent one of the highest cost centers, especially when instances are left running during off-peak hours or periods of inactivity.

I encourage you to read this hashtag#AWS blog post (link in comments) that explores two practical approaches to automatically manage EC2 instances and reduce costs.

The first method uses hashtag#CloudWatch alarms to monitor instance inactivity, while the second employs hashtag#Lambda with hashtag#EventBridge for scheduled shutdowns.

The results speak for themselves - organizations implementing these solutions have seen 𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝟑𝟎% 𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐢𝐧 𝐄𝐂𝟐 𝐜𝐨𝐬𝐭𝐬 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡! 🚀

Best of all, these solutions support sustainable IT practices while improving resource allocation. It's a win-win for both the bottom line and environmental responsibility.

💡 𝐏𝐫𝐨 𝐭𝐢𝐩: Start small, perhaps with non-production environments, and gradually expand as you become comfortable with the automation.
