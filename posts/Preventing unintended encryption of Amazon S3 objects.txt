🚨 𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐭 𝐀𝐖𝐒 𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲 𝐀𝐥𝐞𝐫𝐭 🚨

AWS CIRT has identified an increase in unauthorized encryption of S3 objects using SSE-C (Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys). Malicious actors with valid credentials are re-encrypting customer data!

𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩𝐬:
🛡️ Block SSE-C encryption if not required by your applications
🔑 Implement short-term credentials - avoid long-term access keys 
💾 Enable S3 versioning and implement backup procedures 
🔍 Monitor AWS resources for suspicious patterns using CloudTrail 

𝐑𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐦𝐛𝐞𝐫: This isn't a service vulnerability, but rather unauthorized use of valid credentials. If you suspect any unauthorized activity, contact AWS Support immediately!⚡
