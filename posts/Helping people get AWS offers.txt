In these challenging times where we're seeing massive layoffs affecting entire families and careers, it's important to acknowledge both the difficulties AND the wins.

While my brother Ifeanyi Otuonye, MBA has his inspiring mission of 12 TAM offers in his first 12 months (he's already crushing it btw), I've taken a different approach. 

While everyone has their unique way of giving back, I simply focus on keeping my heart and calendar open to support and pray to whoever needs guidance along the way, especially during these challenging times. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you believe I can be of any assistance on your journey.

And in a little over 7 months, out of 6 people I helped, 5 received Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers in different continents which is awesome!
But let me be clear - THEY did ALL the work and I'm extremely grateful to be part of their journey!

From personal experience throughout my life, I know that being a child of God makes a huge difference [Philippians 4:6-7], and I am here to help as many people as I can.

Keep pushing, keep learning, and keep supporting each other! 🙏
