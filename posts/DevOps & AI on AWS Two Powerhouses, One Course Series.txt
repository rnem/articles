🚀 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗢𝗽𝘀 & 𝗔𝗜 𝗼𝗻 𝗔𝗪𝗦: 𝗧𝘄𝗼 𝗣𝗼𝘄𝗲𝗿𝗵𝗼𝘂𝘀𝗲𝘀, 𝗢𝗻𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗲 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀

I'm excited to invite you to an innovative course series that Morgan Willis posted about earlier that combines two of the most transformative forces in modern software development: 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗢𝗽𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗔𝗿𝘁𝗶𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗮𝗹 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗼𝗻 Amazon Web Services (AWS).

In today's fast-paced tech landscape, staying ahead means mastering both efficient deployment workflows and #AI integration. That's why we've created a comprehensive three-course series that teaches these crucial skills together:

𝗖𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗲 𝟭: 𝗔𝗜 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗴𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗔𝗺𝗮𝘇𝗼𝗻 𝗕𝗲𝗱𝗿𝗼𝗰𝗸 
• Hands-on experience upgrading applications with generative AI 
• Deep dive into DevOps planning and coding phases 
• Build an AI-powered travel guide application

𝗖𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗲 𝟮: 𝗔𝗱𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗱 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗢𝗽𝘀 𝗣𝗶𝗽𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 
• Create automated deployment pipelines for both applications and infrastructure 
• Learn DevOps best practices for AI-powered applications

𝗖𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘀𝗲 𝟯: 𝗔𝗜𝗢𝗽𝘀 𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘆 
• Explore AI-powered operations optimization 
• Hands-on experience with Amazon DevOps Guru and CloudWatch Anomaly Detection 
• Learn to build more efficient cloud operations

What makes this series unique is its practical, hands-on approach to combining #DevOps practices with #AI implementation. 

You'll walk away with real-world experience in building and deploying AI-powered applications using modern DevOps methodologies.
