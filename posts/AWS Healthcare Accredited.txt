I'm excited to share that I've earned both the 𝗔𝗪𝗦 𝗛𝗲𝗮𝗹𝘁𝗵𝗰𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗙𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹 (𝗟𝟭𝟬𝟬) and 𝗔𝗪𝗦 𝗛𝗲𝗮𝗹𝘁𝗵𝗰𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗺𝗲𝗱𝗶𝗮𝘁𝗲 (𝗟𝟮𝟬𝟬) Industry Accreditations! 🎯

These accreditations represent a significant milestone in my ability to serve as a trusted advisor to Healthcare and Life Sciences organizations. Through the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Industry Accreditation Program, I've deepened my understanding of:

✅ Healthcare-specific business outcomes and industry challenges 
✅ AWS solutions tailored to Healthcare use cases 
✅ How to engage effectively with C-suite executives, line of business leaders, and technical teams

Working with some of the largest Healthcare and Life Sciences customers requires more than technical expertise—it demands industry fluency and the ability to translate cloud capabilities into meaningful business transformation.

A big thank you to AWS Training & Certification for providing excellent materials that made this learning journey both comprehensive and impactful.

I'm grateful for this opportunity to enhance how I support our Healthcare customers in their cloud journey and look forward to continuing to deliver differentiated value to this critical industry.
