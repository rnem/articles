📢 It may not be Black Friday yet, but Amazon Web Services (AWS) is giving you a reason to 𝗰𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗯𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗡𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿! ✨

We permanently slashed prices for our #AmazonDynamoDB service a couple of weeks back – a serverless, NoSQL database that delivers lightning-fast performance at any scale and is a game-changer for modern applications, allowing you to start small and seamlessly scale to millions of requests per second.

From this month onwards, you'll enjoy a whopping 𝟓𝟎% 𝐝𝐢𝐬𝐜𝐨𝐮𝐧𝐭 on #AmazonDynamoDB's on-demand usage, and global tables are now 𝐮𝐩 𝐭𝐨 𝟔𝟕% 𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐚𝐩𝐞𝐫! 💸🔥 This pricing revamp exemplifies our "𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐎𝐛𝐬𝐞𝐬𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧" Leadership Principle – we constantly strive to simplify and optimize costs for our customers.

𝐁𝐮𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭'𝐬 𝐧𝐨𝐭 𝐚𝐥𝐥! We've also revamped the pricing for #AmazonDataZone, our fully managed data cataloging service. Amazon DataZone has eliminated monthly subscription fees per user. 🎉 You'll now pay only for the resources you consume through a pay-as-you-go model – 𝐧𝐨 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐩𝐚𝐲𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐮𝐧𝐮𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐜𝐚𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐢𝐭𝐲!

Additionally, we've reduced the price for DataZone's metadata storage from $0.417 to $0.40 per GB. Every penny counts when you're operating at scale! 💰 And to top it off, some of DataZone's core APIs are 𝐧𝐨𝐰 𝐜𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐞𝐥𝐲 𝐟𝐫𝐞𝐞 to use, including creating and managing domains, blueprints, and projects – essential for your data governance workflows.

At #AWS, 𝐰𝐞 𝐥𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐛𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐜𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝𝐬. Reducing your cloud costs is a top priority for us. That's why we continually refine our pricing models, making our services more accessible and cost-effective.
