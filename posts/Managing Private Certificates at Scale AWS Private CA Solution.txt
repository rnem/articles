Organizations face significant challenges in managing private certificates, especially when dealing with diverse workload requirements:

🎯 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗖𝗵𝗮𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗲𝘀: 
• Default 13-month validity periods don't fit all use cases 
• Short-lived certificates needed for containerized environments 
• Long-term certificates required for remote/restricted access systems 
• Manual monitoring of certificate expiration becomes unmanageable at scale 
• Risk of service disruptions due to expired certificates

Amazon Web Services (AWS)'s 𝗻𝗲𝘄 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝘀𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 combines AWS Private CA audit reports, Amazon EventBridge, AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, Amazon SNS, and AWS Security Hub.

The solution automates certificate expiration monitoring and sends renewal notifications. Security Hub provides centralized certificate status visibility, and customizable validity periods match specific workload needs. The automation eliminates manual overhead and improves security controls.
