🤔 Ever wondered if managing AWS infrastructure could be as simple as having a conversation? Well, it just became reality!

I'm excited to share that Amazon Web Services (AWS) has just announced the 𝗔𝗪𝗦 𝗖𝗹𝗼𝘂𝗱 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗹 𝗔𝗣𝗜 (𝗖𝗖𝗔𝗣𝗜) 𝗠𝗖𝗣 𝗦𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗲𝗿 - a groundbreaking tool that lets developers manage their AWS infrastructure using natural language commands!

Imagine simply typing "𝘊𝘳𝘦𝘢𝘵𝘦 𝘢𝘯 𝘚3 𝘣𝘶𝘤𝘬𝘦𝘵 𝘸𝘪𝘵𝘩 𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘪𝘰𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨" and having it done automatically, complete with security best practices and cost estimates. No more wrestling with complex templates or documentation.

K𝗲𝘆 𝗵𝗶𝗴𝗵𝗹𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀: 
• Natural language infrastructure management 
• Automatic security best practices using Checkov 
• Cost estimation integration 
• Support for 1,200+ AWS resources 
• Infrastructure as Code (IaC) template generation

What would be the first thing you'd build if you could just describe it in plain English to AWS?
