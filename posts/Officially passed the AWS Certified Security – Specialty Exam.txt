Since the beginning of my career, security has always been my top priority. I’ve treated it not just as a responsibility, but as a mindset—because in my view, security will always be Job Zero. It’s critical for every organization and for every customer we serve, and I’ve always made it my mission to be as prepared as possible to contribute meaningfully in this space.

For the exam, I took a practical, focused 2-week approach:
✔️ Week 1 – Reviewed key Amazon Web Services (AWS) security-related services
✔️ Week 2 – Studied the AWS FAQs and reinforced my understanding
✔️ Took exam prep questions from AWS Training & Certification – and based on the results, I felt confident to move forward with the test.

I'm glad that my hands-on experience over the years gave me a strong foundation to succeed. 

Full disclosure: I decided to try a little Aaron Hunter pose for this post. 😂

Now, it’s on to the next goal—because in tech, learning never stops. 💪
