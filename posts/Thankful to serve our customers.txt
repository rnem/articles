I’m reminded that “𝘭𝘰𝘰𝘬 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘰𝘯𝘭𝘺 𝘵𝘰 𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘰𝘸𝘯 𝘪𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘴, 𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘢𝘭𝘴𝘰 𝘵𝘰 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘪𝘯𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘵𝘴 𝘰𝘧 𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘴” [Philippians 2:4] as I reflect on the incredible opportunity the Lord has given me—to serve others across the country by doing what I love most.

As a TAM at Amazon Web Services (AWS), I’m blessed to walk alongside incredible customers on every step of their journey. Whether the challenge is simple or complex, the goal is the same: be there, support them, so they can keep moving, keep learning, keep growing, and keep doing what they do best.

This is what customer obsession looks like—earning trust, showing up, and staying focused on what truly matters: their success.

And I’m really glad for the opportunity to meet Tamrah Barber, ICF Certified Professional Coach earlier where she gave us invaluable insights on how to become a trusted advisor, and showing up is a part of it.
