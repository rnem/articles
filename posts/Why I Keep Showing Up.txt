Yesterday, I received a message that reminded me exactly why I do this.

I remember. I remember every conversation, every prayer, every moment of doubt turned into determination.

Let's be honest—our industry is still experiencing brutal layoffs. Getting into Amazon Web Services (AWS) isn't just hard, it's 𝗯𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹𝘆 hard. The competition is fierce, and rejection emails can feel endless.

And yet...

Out of the many people I've guided, several have received AWS offers across different continents.

But here's what moves me most: 𝗧𝗛𝗘𝗬 𝗱𝗶𝗱 𝗔𝗟𝗟 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸.

They studied when exhausted. They practiced when they wanted to give up. They believed when everything seemed impossible.

I was just there—offering guidance, praying alongside them, and believing in them when they struggled to believe in themselves.

This is why I continue.

Because behind every offer email is a story of late nights studying while worrying about bills, rejection after rejection yet choosing to try again, family sacrifices, and resilience that refused to break.

We're not just building careers—we're restoring hope and changing lives.

To everyone still in the fight: You ARE good enough. Keep going. You're not alone.

I'm keeping my heart and calendar open because when we lift each other up, we all rise together. 

If you're preparing for an AWS interview or just need someone to believe in you—please reach out.

Your breakthrough is coming. Keep pushing. Keep believing. Keep supporting each other. 🙏 [𝗠𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘄 𝟭𝟵:𝟮𝟲]

We're in this together.
