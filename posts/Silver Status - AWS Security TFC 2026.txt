Excited to start 2026 with a very meaningful recognition! 

I'm honored to have been awarded 𝗦𝗶𝗹𝘃𝗲𝗿 status in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Security & Compliance Technical Field Community (TFC) for my contributions in 2025.

As an Enterprise TAM at AWS, I'm dedicated to helping enterprise customers design secure cloud architectures aligned with industry best practices. Customer obsession is a core leadership principle at AWS, and because of this, it's incredibly important to me to help customers where they need it most. I'm privileged to support Healthcare & Life Sciences customers as they navigate complex compliance requirements while innovating in the cloud.

Security is job zero at AWS, and this principle is especially critical for the organizations I work with. This recognition reflects the collaborative work with customers and colleagues to strengthen security postures and build resilient, compliant cloud environments. 

Looking forward to continuing this important work and setting my sights on achieving Gold status in 2026!
